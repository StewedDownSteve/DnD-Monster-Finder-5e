# Monster Finder for DnD 5e

Monster Finder for DnD 5e is a web application that leverages the DnD5e API to fetch and display detailed information about Dungeons & Dragons monsters. Users can search for monsters by name and view their images, sizes, types, alignments, and armor classes.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript

This project was built using HTML for structure, CSS and Bootstrap for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity. I utilized the Fetch API to make requests to the DnD5e API, allowing users to search for monsters seamlessly. The search bar enables users to input monster names and receive real-time results displayed below. This project showcases my skills in front-end development and my ability to work with APIs effectively.

## Optimizations

In this project, I implemented several optimizations to enhance performance. I used `async/await` for handling asynchronous calls in JavaScript, which made the code cleaner and more readable. Error handling was also incorporated to manage API call failures gracefully, providing feedback to users in case of issues.

## Lessons Learned:

Working on the Monster Finder project solidified my understanding of using JavaScript for fetching information from APIs. Given the extensive nature of the DnD5e API, I learned how to effectively navigate different categories and utilize Object-Oriented Programming concepts to access the correct data and display it efficiently. This experience helped bridge the connection between front-end and back-end functions.
